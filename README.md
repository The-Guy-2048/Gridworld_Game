# Gridworld_Game
I have created a game I am calling Gridworld.  the game works on a grid-based tile placement, and you can shoot zombies in play mode on each wave.  call waves with G and have fun.

Very important,  when you run this, make sure you include the whole folder.(the zipped Gridorld-update-Game one)
thing.py is the one that I made, the "totally-my-code.py" is not mine, just a friends, you can find him on github, I forgot where tho...
the mouse detection one was troubleshooting/tool.

also, the save/load needs updating...
